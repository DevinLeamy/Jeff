Jot is a CLI tool for managing notes, being built as an alternative to Obsidian. 
<br>
While Obsidian is an excellent knowledge management tool, it often proves to be overkill for my purposes. Plus, the GUI only slows me down. The obvious solution for speed coupled with simplicity (for a programmer) is the terminal. Since Obsidian doesn't have a CLI client or an API that can enable the creation of one, I decided to make a (*in The Primeagen's voice*) blaaaazing fast⚡ and lightweight CLI alternative.

## Highlights
- Jot is under active development.
- Jot uses files and folders for notes and vaults just like Obsidian.
- Jot is aimed at reducing the time taken to perform tasks, so, each command is a two letter abbreviation of the word(s) that describe it.  

## Notes
- App data is stored in config and data files in locations generated by the [directories](https://crates.io/crates/directories) crate. It is advised that these files not be messed with, since atm there's no way to automatically fix them.
- App config has two fields: *editor* & *conflict*.
    - *editor* by default is set to *nvim* and conflict to *true*.
    - *conflict* field tells the app if the editor conflicts with it for control over the terminal. Set it to *true* for editors like *nvim* and *false* for editors like *notepad*.
- This tool has not been tested on platforms other than Windows as yet.
