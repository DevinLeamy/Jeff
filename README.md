Jot is a blazing fastâš¡cli alternative for obsidian built with rust.
<br>
While Obsidian is an excellent knowledge management tool, it proves to be overkill when all I want to do is jot down (pun intended) some notes and manage them locally, plus the GUI can often slow things down. Since Obsidian doesn't have a CLI client or an API that can enable the creation of one, I decided to make a fast and lightweight CLI alternative.

Notes:
    - Jot is under active development.
    - Jot uses files and folders for notes and vaults just like Obsidian.
    - App data is stored in config and data files in locations generated by the [directories](https://crates.io/crates/directories) crate. It is advised that these files not be messed with, since atm there's no way to automatically fix these files.
    - App config has two fields atm: *editor* & *conflict*.
        - *editor* by default is set to *nvim* and conflict to *true*.
        - *conflict* field tells the app if the editor conflicts with it for control over the terminal window. Set it to *true* for editors like *nvim* and *false* for editors like *code*.
